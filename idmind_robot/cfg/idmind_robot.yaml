bot:
  name: "raposa"        # Unique name for the robot (to be used for logging in future)
  kinematics: "2wd"     # Kinematics can be 2wd or omni
  base_width: 0.6       # Distance from wheel to wheel (if the robot has special configuration, rethink this and navigation)
  wheel_radius: 0.09    # Radius of the wheel, to be used for navigation
  max_vel: 0.7          # Maximum robot velocity
  max_rot: 2.3          # Maximum robot angular velocity (Max vel / Base_radius)
